## Hi there 👋

Hey there!
I’m Saad, a software engineer based in Morocco.

I love turning ideas into real applications — from full-stack web apps to computer vision projects. I enjoy learning new technologies, improving systems, and building things that actually solve problems.

My main stack includes Java/Spring Boot, with experience in React, Node.js, Laravel and Python. I like clean code, simple design, and practical solutions.

Fun Facts:
• Big fan of Game of thrones
• Always learning something new
• Passionate about building and improving things
